=== CDI observers and Vert.x message consumers

Vert.x makes use of a light-weight distributed messaging system to allow application components to communicate in a loosely coupled way. `weld-vertx-core` makes it possible to notify CDI observer methods when a message is sent via Vert.x event bus. A simple echo message consumer example:

[source,java]
----
import org.jboss.weld.vertx.VertxConsumer;
import org.jboss.weld.vertx.VertxEvent;

class Foo {
    // VertxConsumer - a qualifier used to specify the address of the message consumer
    // VertxEvent - a Vert.x message wrapper
    void echoConsumer(@Observes @VertxConsumer("echo.address") VertxEvent event) {
        event.setReply(event.getMessageBody());
    }
}
----

Since we’re working with a regular observer method, additional parameters may be declared (next to the event parameter). These parameters are injection points. So it’s easy to declare a message consumer dependencies:

[source,java]
----
void consumerWithDependencies(@Observes @VertxConsumer("dependencies.address") VertxEvent event, CoolService coolService, StatsService statsService) {
    coolService.process(event.getMessageBody());
    statsService.log(event);
}
----

NOTE: If you inject a dependent bean, it will be destroyed when the invocation completes.

Last but not least - an observer may also send/publish messages using the Vert.x event bus:

[source,java]
----
void consumerStrikesBack(@Observes @VertxConsumer("publish.address") VertxEvent event) {
    event.messageTo("test.huhu.address").publish("huhu");
}
----

==== How does it work?

The central point of integration is the `org.jboss.weld.vertx.VertxExtension`.
Its primary task is to find all CDI observer methods that should be notified when a message is sent via `io.vertx.core.eventbus.EventBus`.

If a `Vertx` instance is available during CDI bootstrap, then `VertxExtension` also:

* registers a Vert.x handler for each address found (whenever a new message is delivered to the handler, `Event.fire()` is used to notify all observers bound to a specific address)
* adds custom beans for `io.vertx.core.Vertx` and `io.vertx.core.Context` (thereby allowing to inject relevant instances into beans)

NOTE: Handlers use `Vertx.executeBlocking()` since we expect the code to be blocking.

`org.jboss.weld.vertx.WeldVerticle` starts/stops the Weld SE container and registers `VertxExtension` automatically. However, `VertxExtension.registerConsumers(Vertx, Event<Object>)` could be also used after the bootstrap, e.g. when a Vertx instance is only available after a CDI container is initialized.

=== CDI-powered Verticles

It's also possible to deploy Verticles produced/injected by Weld, e.g.:

[source,java]
----
@Dependent
class MyVerticle extends AbstractVerticle {

     @Inject
     Service service;

     @Override
     public void start() throws Exception {
         vertx.eventBus().consumer("my.address").handler(m -> m.reply(service.process(m.body())));
     }
}

class MyApp {
     public static void main(String[] args) {
         Vertx vertx = Vertx.vertx();
         WeldVerticle weldVerticle = new WeldVerticle();
         vertx.deployVerticle(weldVerticle, r -> {
             if (r.succeeded()) {
                 // Deploy Verticle instance produced by Weld
                 MyVerticle myVerticle = weldVerticle.container().select(MyBeanVerticle.class).get();
                 vertx.deployVerticle(myVerticle);
             }
         });
     }
}
----

=== `AsyncReference`

CDI bean instance creation is synchronous.
As a result if you inject a bean whose initialization involves potentially blocking operations (e.g. fetching some data from DB) the creation process is blocked until the dependency is ready.
`AsyncReference` is an *asynchronously processed wrapper of an injectable reference* (also implements `CompletionStage`) which allows to finish the client bean creation before a dependency is ready.
It's suitable e.g. when injecting a bean whose creation involves potentially blocking operations:

[source,java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
class Hello {

    @Inject
    AsynReference<ServiceWithBlockingInit> service;

    CompletionStage<String> hello() {
        return service.thenApply(s -> "Hello" + s.getName() + "!");
    }
}
----


If there is a producer method whose return type is `CompletionStage` where the result type matches the required type and has all the required qualifers (according to type-safe resolution rules) then `CompletionStage#whenComplete(java.util.function.BiConsumer)` is used to process the reference.
Otherwise, a worker thread is used so that the processing does not block the event loop thread.

=== `AsyncWorker`

`AsyncWorker` allows to wrap a synchronous action as an asynchronous computation.
The action is performed either as blocking operation using a Vertx worker thread or as non-blocking operation using the Vertx event-loop thread:

[source,java]
----
@Dependent
public class Hello {

    @Inject
    AsyncWorker worker;

    @Inject
    Service service;

    CompletionStage<String> hello() {
        return worker.performBlocking(service::getMessageFromDb).thenApply(m -> "Hello " + m + "!");
    }
}
----

It's also possible to combine `AsyncWorker` with `AsyncReference`:

[source,java]
----


public class HelloCombo {

    @Inject
    AsyncWorker worker;

    @Inject
    AsyncReference<Service> serviceRef;

    CompletionStage<String> hello() {
        return serviceRef.thenCompose(service ->
        // At this point Service is ready
        // But getMessage() is also blocking
        worker.performBlocking(service::getMessage)
                // Finally modify the final message
                .thenApply(m -> "Hello " + m + "!"));
    }

}
